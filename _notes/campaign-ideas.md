Crosswalk
=========

> Crosswalk is a specialized WebView for building Hybrid mobile applications.

## What WebView are you using?

Over 900 million Android devices have been activated since being introduced in 2008 and 1.5 Million Android devices are activated each and every day. How many are you reaching?

## Unlock the power of tomorrow web, today!

Whether you are building a game using WebGL or displaying beutiful typography using Woff, Crosswalk offers a consistent cross browser environment for all your modern HTML5 needs. Get it today.

## Available Today

Crosswalk is compatible with Apache Cordova either manual installation or as a one-click install on the XDK Development Platform.

You may also use Crosswalk as a module within your native application.

## One less unknown in hybrid app development

## A frame that’s worth a thousand pictures

[Use a picture frame metaphor, where Android devices are the myriad of frames and you don’t know how the image will look]

## Browser metaphor

- The browser you wish you were always developing for
- Give everyone the browser you wished they were using
- You can’t make them use the browser you want, but you can make them use 
- What if you could control what browsers visited your site?
- You can’t control what browsers visit your site, but you can control what web view houses your app.
- You might not get a say on what browser visits your site, but you can control what web view houses your app.

## Normalize your app’s web view

## A hybrid app is only as good as its web view

[You could upgrade from Cordova 2 to Cordova 3.5 and it might not make from, but if you upgrade to Crosswalk, you can actually get new features, at this point, all painful parts of hybrid app development come from the environment or the web view. The same way browsers compete, maybe web views should be competing, and they are trying to make the best one]

## Reliable view

- Give your users the app you intended
- Give your users the web view you developed on
- Your app with/without the Crosswalk

> Until Crosswalk, my application development was full of compromises due to Android fragmentation

## Crosswalk makes Android fragmentation a moot point

## Makes Android web views predictable

## Notes

We should definitely be calling it a web view because that’s what the native app development community calls it (ex. Instapaper’s article view would literally be instantiating a web view)

It’s a native tool that’s compatible with Cordova, not the other way around
