## Make the most of your `WebView`

What’s a WebView? A WebView is like full-screen browser inside a native app where you can run HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Crosswalk provides predictability on Android.

### By default

When you choose the default WebView, your users could be using the latest version of Android or seeing the web from 2011—or anywhere else in between.

### Upgraded with Crosswalk

Include Intel Crosswalk in your app, and all your users will see your app at its best: through a predictable, powerful WebView based on the latest version of Google Chromium.

> The bulk of our user interactions occur on the HTML5 front end. …we see almost around 1,000 different devices streaming Netflix on Android every day.

## Which `WebView` are you choosing?

Stop choosing a fragmented development environment. Over 1.3 million Android device are activated every, each with an slightly different interpretation of the web.

It’s impossible to imagine and painful to test how your native hybrid app will render or perform in every situation if you’ve chosen the default Android `WebView`.

#### Use Crosswalk and build great interfaces

Use new features confidently. Crosswalk supports otherwise unpredictable properties and APIs, whether they are in CSS or JavaScript.

#### Use Device APIs, with or without Cordova

Whether your using Cordova or not, the Crosswalk supports the Geolocation API, the File API, the vibration API and more.

#### Flexbox is ready with Crosswalk

Reliably build responsive user interfaces with Flexbox. Your app will render it properly on any Android 4.0+ device when Crosswalk is included.

#### Give your users the latest version of the web

With Crosswalk, your app will render the same across every Android 4.0 device, so you can simultaneously test on less devices and know your apps works in more places.

#### Provide a Google Chrome-like in-app browser

In-app browsers are used more than the default Android browser. Give your users the latest version of the web by with Crosswalk as your app’s embedded browser. 

#### Icon fonts, SVG, Flexbox, and more

Crosswalk supports exactly what you’d expect from a WebView based on Google Chromium and Blink. Easily make your users’ browser and experience great.

#### New monitoring APIs

The more browsers that support new performance monitoring APIs, the more accurate your numbers will be. Crosswalk helps increase your sample size.
