## What web view are you using?

Stop choosing a fragmented development enivronment. Over 1.3 million Android device are activated every, each with an slightly different interpretation of the web.

It’s impossible to imagine and painful to test how your native hybrid app will render or perform in every situation if you’ve chosen the default Android WebView.

## Can’t I just limit support to the latest versions?

> Even when you don’t support older Android versions, fragmentation is a huge drain on resources.

Dropping support for  is one option, but it reduces your app’s reach and doesn’t solve the problem. Significant fragmentation exists event within the latest version of Android—there will still be unpredictability.

> The bulk of our user interactions occur on the HTML5 front end. …we see almost around 1,000 different devices streaming Netflix on Android every day.

## Does your `WebView` power reliable apps?

Chances are, your customers use as many different Android devices as Netflix’s, but see as many different devices as Netflix, but not have the resources or support to test like them.

With Crosswalk, your app will render the same across every Android 4.0 device, so you can efficiently develop more predictable and performant apps.
