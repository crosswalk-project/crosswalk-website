# Contributing to Crosswalk
Crosswalk is an open source project. Source code is hosted on 
[GitHub](http://github.com/crosswalk-project). Bugs, features, and issues 
are tracked using [JIRA](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira).

## Building
The first step to contributing to Crosswalk is to get a build environment configured and operational. The [Building Crosswalk](#contribute/building_crosswalk) page provides that information. In addition to the binaries Crosswalk provides for the supported operating systems, the build infrastructure can generate projects for additional platforms. 

## Debugging
Once you have a build environment, familiarize yourself with the debugging process. There are steps describing that 
process in the [Crosswalk Developer's wiki](#wiki/home/for-developers) page.

## Contributing
Now you just need to pick something to focus working on. You can look 
through the [Issues](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira), 
or hop on IRC and ask what people could use help on.

Be sure to follow the [contribution guidelines](#contribute/contributing-code) as you develop your changes.

## Testing
Everything related to test scope, test execution plan, and running tests 
can be found on the [Crosswalk Testing Home](#wiki/crosswalk-testing-home).

## Questions?
Jump on IRC and chat with other developers; they hang out on Freenode in the #crosswalk channel. Details in the [Community](#documentation/community) page.
