# Contributing to Crosswalk

Crosswalk is an open source project. Source code is hosted on
[GitHub](http://github.com/crosswalk-project). Bugs, features, and issues
are tracked using [JIRA](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira).

## Building
The first step to contributing to Crosswalk is to get a build environment configured and operational. The [Building Crosswalk](/contribute/building_crosswalk.html) page provides that information. In addition to the binaries Crosswalk provides for the supported operating systems, the build infrastructure can generate projects for additional platforms.

## Debugging
Once you have a build environment, familiarize yourself with the debugging process. There are steps describing that
process in the [Crosswalk Developer's wiki](https://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk-website/wiki/home/for-developers) page.

## Contributing
Now you just need to pick something to focus working on. You can look
through the [Issues](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira),
or hop on IRC and ask what people could use help on.

Be sure to follow the [contribution guidelines](/contribute/contributing-code.html) as you develop your changes.
