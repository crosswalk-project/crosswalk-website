HTML5 brings many advantages, ranging from easy integration with cloud services to super flexible layout primitives. It also brings value to app developers with its openness, deployment model and with responsive design built in.

The web platform is rapidly improving, with new versions of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and with an increased focus on mobile performance and web components a standard way to encapsulate and create reusable UI and logic components. But to many developers basic things are still missing and that makes it hard to adopt the web as it is today.

With Crosswalk that changesÍ¾ Crosswalk is an HTML application runtime, built on an open source foundation. It extends today's web platform with new capabilities, empowering applications written using web technologies.

By using Crosswalk, an application developer can:

- Access the latest recommended and emerging web standards
- Control the upgrade cycle of an application by distributing it with its own runtime
- Add custom extensions to an application to take advantage of platform features not exposed by Crosswalk or the standardized web platform

At the heart of Crosswalk is the Blink rendering and layout engine. This provides the same HTML5 features and capabilities you would expect to find in any modern web browser.

Building on Blink, Crosswalk uses parts and modules of Chromium to provide a multiprocess architecture, designed for security and performance, as well as state of the art performance and graphics.
