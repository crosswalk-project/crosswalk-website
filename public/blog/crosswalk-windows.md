We are pleased to announce the first canary version of [Crosswalk Project for Windows](https://download.01.org/crosswalk/releases/crosswalk/windows), a runtime for modern web applications.

Crosswalk Project for Windows is based on the Chromium content layer and support cutting-edge web technologies like WebGL, WebRTC, WebAudio, ServiceWorker, SIMD, and Web Manifest.

The JavaScript API extension mechanism is also supported, allowing developers to extend web application capabilities and bridge native code with their JavaScript code to make competitive hybrid Windows desktop applications. This extensions can be written in .NET or C/C++ allowing you to leverage the Windows APIs.

Finally, Crosswalk Project for Windows provides tools for developers to package their applications into MSI installers. Web applications with standard W3C web app manifests can easily be packaged from the command-line and deployed across Windows computers. See [the documentation](/documentation/windows.html) for instructions.

The Crosswalk Project for Windows is available from the canary channel and has been tested on Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. Note that we are still in the early phases of the project and some things may not work as expected. Please report your bugs on https://crosswalk-project.org/jira.

We look forward to hearing your feedback!
