# Tizen Extension APIs

In addition to the experimental Crosswalk APIs, the Crosswalk developers have created
a Crosswalk extension for Tizen users which provides many of the Tizen
APIs. You can find information on those APIs on the [Tizen Extension APIs](https://github.com/crosswalk-project/tizen-extensions-crosswalk/wiki/APIs) page.
