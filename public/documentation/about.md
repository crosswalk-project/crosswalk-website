# About

Crosswalk is an HTML application runtime, built on open source foundations, which extends the web platform with new capabilities.

The web platform already has many advantages, from easy cloud services integration to flexible user interface elements. Recently, the platform has become even more attractive, with its increased focus on mobile performance and device APIs.

However, for many developers, basic functionality is still missing, making it hard to adopt the web as it is today.

**With Crosswalk, this situation changes.**

By using Crosswalk, an application developer can:

*   Use all the features available in modern web browsers: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
*   Access the latest recommended and emerging web standards.
*   Use experimental APIs not available in mainstream web browsers.
*   Control the upgrade cycle of an application by distributing it with its own runtime.
*   Add custom extensions to an application, to leverage platform features not exposed by Crosswalk or the standardized web platform.

Crosswalk is open source, released under a [BSD licence](https://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk/blob/master/LICENSE). The project was founded by Intel's Open Source Technology Center.
