# Crosswalk Project for Windows

The Crosswalk Project for Windows provides a web runtime for web and hybrid applications for the Windows operating system. This section describes how to create and build these applications.

**This tutorial explains how to:**

 1. [Set up the Windows host](/documentation/windows/windows_host_setup.html): the machine where you will be developing the application.
It is only possible to use Crosswalk for Windows on the Windows platform.
 2. [Build a very simple HTML5 application](/documentation/windows/build_an_application.html).
 3. [Run your application using the a stable release of Crosswalk](/documentation/windows/run_on_windows.html).

You will need to be comfortable using a command line to follow these steps.

In the documentation, commands you should run in a shell are prefixed with a > character. On Windows, you can use the standard Windows cmd shell (launched with "cmd" from the Start menu).

By the end of the tutorial, you should understand the workflow for creating Crosswalk applications from your own HTML5 projects.

**This tutorial does not cover:**

*   How to write HTML5 applications. We use a simple HTML5 application for this tutorial, so we can focus on the packaging and deployment aspects of Crosswalk.
*    How to use [Crosswalk-specific APIs](http://xwalk.com/documentation/apis/web_apis.html#Experimental-APIs). The code in the tutorial should run on any modern web browser, as well as on Crosswalk.
*    How to compile Crosswalk itself. This is covered in the [Contribute](http://xwalk.com/contribute) section.
