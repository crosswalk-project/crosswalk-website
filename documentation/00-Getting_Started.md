# Getting Started
This site is designed to help you get up and running with Crosswalk as quickly as possible.

## Step 1 - Download Crosswalk
The Crosswalk project currently provides binaries for Android and Tizen. Go to the [Downloads](#documentation/Downloads) page, pick your operating system, and download.

## Step 2 - Install Crosswalk on your device
You can run Crosswalk either directly on a device supporting your selected operating system, or in one of the emulators provided by those operating system SDKs. 

You can find steps for installing Crosswalk onto the device or into the emulator on the [Installing Crosswalk](#documentation/getting_started/installing_crosswalk) page.

## Step 3 - Package your application
Crosswalk applications are made up of your HTML5 files and a manifest 
file. When deploying your application, you would package those files 
into a single archive. During development you can skip that step. The 
steps for packaging your application are found on the [Building an 
application](#documentation/getting_started/Building_an_Application) 
page.

## Step 4 - Running your application
The steps for pushing your application to the target device and 
launching Crosswalk with your application are covered on the [Running an 
Application](#documentation/getting_started/Running_an_Application) 
page.
