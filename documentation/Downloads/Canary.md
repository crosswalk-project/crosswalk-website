The Canary release is generated on a frequent basis (sometimes daily) based on a recent tip of master that passes a full build and automatic basic acceptance test. The Canary build lets developers that are interested in the absolute latest features, and which don’t want to build Crosswalk themselves, an easy option for working with the latest Crosswalk releases.
